# LAW-155: The Minimization Mandate

## Discovery
Raw diffusion models (Chai-1, AlphaFold) often contain static atomic overlaps
that resolve under energy minimization.

## Rule
Tier 1 geometric audit must include post-minimization validation:
1. Pre-minimization audit with 2.5Å threshold
2. 100-step energy minimization (Amber14/OBC2)
3. Post-minimization re-audit

## Thresholds
- **Pre-minimization:** Clashes < 2.5Å flagged as warnings
- **Post-minimization:** Clashes < 2.5Å = VETO, clashes < 1.9Å = CRITICAL_VETO

## Evidence
- TwinRod-v2: 1 clash → 0 clashes, contacts preserved (334 vs 336)
- CHAMP-005: 7 clashes → 0 clashes, but 26% contact loss (147 vs 199)

## Interpretation Guidance
Structures that resolve clashes via significant repositioning should be
flagged for validation by alternative methods (cross-model triangulation).
