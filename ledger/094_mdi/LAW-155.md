# ⚖️ LAW-155: The Minimization Mandate (Hardened)

- **Observation:** Raw diffusion coordinate generation (Chai-1/AF3) produces "Static Clashes" that resolve under energy minimization.
- **Protocol:** Tier 1 Geometric Audits are non-authoritative without a 100-step Amber14/OBC2 relaxation.
- **Metric (Stability):** Bipodal leads must exhibit < 5% Contact Density loss during relaxation to be designated as "Locked."
- **Baseline:**
    - CHAMP-005: 2.86 Å (Meta-stable / 26% Rho-loss)
    - TwinRod-v2: 2.80 Å (Sovereign Lock / 0.6% Rho-loss)
