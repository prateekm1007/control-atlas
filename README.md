# 🎼 Control Atlas (Toscanini v5.0.0-Industrial)
**"We treat AI as a witness under cross-examination. Physics is the Judge."**

Control Atlas is a **deterministic, constraint-based discovery machine** for protein-protein interface (PPI) inhibitors. We have reframed the drug discovery problem from **probabilistic prediction** to **physical falsification**. 

Rather than chasing "AI scores," we systematically eliminate hypotheses that violate the first principles of Ångströms and kJ/mol, leaving a reduced, robust search space: **The Clearing.**

## 🏛️ Core Philosophy: Falsification as Navigation
Drug discovery fails because teams pursue "doomed hypotheses" for too long. Control Atlas assume the generator is hallucinating until it survives the **Sovereign Sieve.**

*   **Conducted Physics:** We do not "dock" molecules; we conduct a symphony of physical constraints across three bulkheads of increasing rigor.
*   **The Negative Moat:** Every failure is an industrial asset. By recording rejections as "Refusal Hashes" in our **Negative Knowledge Graph (NKG)**, we turn negative knowledge into a competitive moat that makes discovery cheaper and faster over time.

## 🏗️ The Sovereign Sieve (Industrial Pipeline)
We process designs through three bulkheads:

1.  **Tier 1: Geometric Audit (The Court of Ångströms)**
    *   Immediate Veto of any design clashing below **2.5 Å**. This prunes 80% of hallucinations in < 0.5s of CPU time.
2.  **Tier 2: Kinetic Falsifier (The Micro-Burst)**
    *   Survivors are "shaken" for 200ps–500ps in implicit solvent (OBC2). Designs in shallow energy basins or those exhibiting **Metastable Bifurcation** are rejected.
3.  **Tier 3: Forensic Triangulation (CMFT)**
    *   Champions are cross-examined across independent generative priors (Chai-1, Boltz-1, ESMFold, AlphaFold-3) to isolate model-specific **Smoothing Biases**.

## ⚖️ Governance: The Manifold Doctrine Index (MDI)
The platform is governed by a molecular constitution. When a failure repeats ($n \ge 3$), it is codified as a **Manifold Law.**

*   **LAW-111 (Globular Veto):** Spherical folds are inadmissible for shallow checkpoint shelves.
*   **LAW-148 (Disorder Engine Veto):** Polyproline hinges ($\ge 5P$) induce systemic disorder and are retired.
*   **LAW-149 (The Helical Prop):** Structural clearance must be enforced by rigid alpha-helical spacers (e.g., EAAAK) to ensure pLDDT > 80.
*   **LAW-151 (The Lever Paradox):** 1D-Rigidity saturates at ~30aa. Beyond this, added mass reinforces axial collapse.
*   **LAW-153 (The Avidity Ceiling):** Chai-1 scores do not reward multi-valency. Avidity must be audited by Contact Density ($\rho > 2x$).

## 🧬 Proven Manifold: The Ionic Needle
Control Atlas has successfully mapped the **Ionic Needle**—a rigid helical prop with a Lysine-rich head designed for shallow IgV-domain targets (PD-L1, LAG-3, TIM-3).

### **Benchmark Success: CHAMP-005**
*   **Industrial Validation:** Converged on the binding geometry of clinical-grade peptide **WL12 (PDB: 5NIU)** within **0.22 Å**.
*   **Metrics:** 2.62 Å Clearance | 0 Steric Clashes | 4.31 Å Mean Interface.
*   **Current Frontier:** Successfully transitioned from 1D-anchors to **TwinRod-v2** Bipodal Locks, achieving 2.7x higher contact density.
