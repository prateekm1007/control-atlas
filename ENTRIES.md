## Phase 1 — Mechanism Mapping [LOCKED]
001–012: COMPLETE

## Phase 2 — Control Discovery
| Entry | Title | Status | Notes |
|------:|-------|--------|-------|
| 013 | Motif Extraction | LOCKED | M001 split into atomic motifs |
| 014 | Geometry Search (a–g) | LOCKED | **FALSIFIED**: geometry insufficient |
| 015 | State Manifold | ACTIVE | Physics-gated (post-016) |
| 016 | Pocket Physics Gate | LOCKED | Concavity + polarity validated |
| 017 | Failure Simulation | PLANNED | Resistance logic |
| 018 | Chemistry Grammar | PLANNED | Pocket → chemistry |
| 019 | Generative Control | PLANNED | Design engine |
| 020 | Cross-Family Proof | PLANNED | Generalization test |

## Locked Scientific Claims
1. Geometry alone cannot identify control sites (014)
2. Pocket physics discriminates true control sites (016)
3. Control sites occupy constrained state manifolds (015 – in progress)
