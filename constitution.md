# ⚖️ Toscanini MDI Constitution (v5.0.0)

## LAW-148: Polyproline Disorder Veto
- Binders with ≥ 5 consecutive Prolines are VETOED.
- Reason: Induces systemic disorder (pLDDT < 70) and creates docking artifacts.

## LAW-149: Helical Prop Mandate
- Structural clearance must be enforced by rigid alpha-helical spacers (e.g., AEAAK).
- Requirement: pLDDT must exceed 80 for structural lead status.

## LAW-151: The Lever Paradox
- Single-rod rigidity saturates at ~30aa. 
- Mass added distal to the warhead reinforces axial collapse.

## LAW-153: The Avidity Ceiling
- Chai-1 scores are capped for symmetric multivalent ligands.
- Avidity success is audited by Contact Density (ρ > 500) and clearance synchronization.
