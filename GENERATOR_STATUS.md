# Control Atlas — Generator Status

Status: UNBOUND

As of this checkpoint, Control Atlas has no atom-minting backend wired.
All generation is design-only and non-material.

Implications:
- No PDBs may be minted
- Tier-3 MD is disabled by construction
- All outputs are symbolic / structural intents only

This is an intentional sovereign state.
