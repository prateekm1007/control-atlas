# Control Atlas — Project Status
Date: 2025-12-29

## SYSTEM STATE
STABLE, GENERALIZABLE, SCALING-READY

---

## PHASES
- Phase 1 (Mechanism): LOCKED
- Phase 2 (Physics Discovery): LOCKED
- Phase 3 (Productization & Scale): ACTIVE

---

## CORE SCIENTIFIC RESULTS
- Geometry-only pocket discovery falsified (Entry 014)
- Surface physics gates true control pockets (Entry 016)
- Resistance-predictive logic validated (Entry 017, 023)
- Deterministic chemistry grammar derived from physics (Entry 018)
- Gatekeeper rejects >90% decoys pre-docking (Entry 020–021)

---

## SCALING STATUS
- COSMIC Drivers Ingested: 20
- Physics Computed: 17 (85%)
- Quality Validated: 15
- Pocket Classes Defined: 7
- Pan-Target Grammar: v1.0 LOCKED

---

## OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION HANDLING
- IDH2, FLT3 flagged as novel pocket classes
- Large-volume control sites exceed current manifold
- Correctly excluded from grammar confidence (not rejected)

---

## KNOWN CURATION TASKS (NON-BLOCKING)
- JAK2 (4IVA): residue numbering / chain mismatch
- EGFR_T790M, FGFR3_S249C: PDB alignment cleanup

---

## KEY ARTIFACTS
- library/pocket_catalog/        (multi-target pocket atlas)
- pan_target_grammar.json       (universal chemistry rules)
- validate_candidate.py         (production gatekeeper)
- assess_quality.py             (admission criteria)

## SCIENTIFIC CLAIM
Control Atlas converts protein structure into a computable,
physics-governed control space that generalizes across oncogenic classes.
